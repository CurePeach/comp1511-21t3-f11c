# comp1511-21t3-f11c

Hello everyone!!

My name is Clarissa and Adam will be your lab assistant! They will be CC’d
in this email so you can easily find our emails when you ever need to contact 
us. If you ever forget or lose this email, another method is to go on the 
*Timetable* page on the course website and search for our names there.

Some important information:

* The course website IS NOT Moodle and IS NOT Webcms3 like in previous terms. 
The course website is found at this link: https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/21T3/ 
All the course information is here including the course outline, lecture slides, 
tutorial questions, lab exercises and your marks.
* To attend the tutorial and lab (and help sessions which start a few weeks into 
the term), use the link on Moodle to access Blackboard Collaborate. More in-depth 
instructions are below.

Instructions to attend the tutorial:

1. Open Moodle, log in and open the COMP1511 course.
2. Click on **Blackboard Collaborate -- Tutorials; Labs; Help-Sessions**.
3. Go to page 3 using the button at the bottom.
4. Click on **F11C (Fri) Week: 1-5,7-10 Clarissa Tatang+Adam Brieger** which will be 
highlighted in bold when the tutorial is in session.
5. What you just clicked on was a folder, so you need to click on the current week’s 
session which will also be highlighted in bold.

Tasks for you!

* Set up home computing on your local machine! We have plenty of resources for that 
at this link: https://cgi.cse.unsw.edu.au/~cs1511/21T3/resources/home_computing.html 
and if you have any questions, feel free to email, post on the forum or ask in the lab. 
It’s okay if you don’t have it set up before the tutorial, we will help you in the lab 
if you’re having any trouble.
* Speaking about the forum... please sign in and register to the forum! The link to the 
forum is on the course website and here: https://discourse.cse.unsw.edu.au/21t3/comp1511/ 
Check out the introduction thread and if you have any questions on how to use the forum, 
bring it up in the tutorial and I can demonstrate.
* Before the tutorial, have a look at the tutorial questions. Attempt as many as you can 
and make a note of the ones that you struggled with or didn’t know. We will cover those 
in the tutorial.
